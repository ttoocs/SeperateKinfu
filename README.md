# What is this
A simple CMakeLists.txt file for building just kinfu out of pcl.
Also provided is a simple bash script to grab the relivant files out of a git source of pcl.

Note: this still depends on a installed version of PCL with gpu/cuda built.


#Todo:

Remove (or include) pcl's cuda/gpu dependencies.
