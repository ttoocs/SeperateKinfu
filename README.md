# What is this
* A simple CMakeLists.txt file for building just kinfu out of pcl.
* Also provided is a simple bash script to symlink the relivant files from a pcl git.
* Note: this still depends on a installed version of PCL with gpu/cuda built.

#Todo:

Remove (or include) pcl's cuda/gpu dependencies.
